Royal Canadian blended
The spicy aroma had mended me
Matured for years and imported
Into my glass you poured it

And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me

You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me

Wild Turkey's been chosen
Its caramel nose can smell me
Arbourler, Jameson, I love you
The single malts come burning

Ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone
Lived nine to five and he worked his fingers to the bone
Just barely out of school, came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, no

He had no money, no
No good at home
Walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
And now it's

Tequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline
It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean
They say he loved adventure, ""Ricky's the wild one""
He married trouble, had a courtship with a gun

Bang-bang, shoot 'em up, the party never ends
You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend

I won't deny myself
Disrespect you have given
Your suffering's my wealth
I feed off pain, force fed to love it
And now I swallow whole
I'll never live in the past
Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast
Burn my fist to the concrete
My fear is my strength

Been pounded by the streets
Cyanide blood burns down the skyline
Hatred is purity

Bring that shit in
Ugh
Yeah, the movement's in motion with mass militant poetry
Now check this out
Ugh
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back!
Bam! Here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear!
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract...
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back!
C'mon, c'mon
We gotta take the power back!

The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the STRUCTURE of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Cause holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior?
Who's inferior?
Yeah we need to check the interior
Of the system that cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back!
C'mon, c'mon
We gotta take the power back!
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it, break it, break it down
Aw shit

And like this, ugh
C'mon
Yeah
Bring it back the other way
Ugh

The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to some of that bullshit that he learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a THING from it, yet we hang from it!
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin Weathermen)
To expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back!

Yeah, we gotta take the power back!
C'mon, c'mon
We gotta take the power back!

Sky high in the airwaves on the morning show
And there's a lifeline slipping as the record plays
As I open the blinds in my mind, I'm believing that you could stay

And oh, if you stay
I'll chase the rain-blown fields away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun
Oh, if you stay
We'll be the wild ones, running with the dogs today

There's a song playing through another wall
All we see and believe is the DJ and debts dissolve
And it's a shame the plane is leaving on this sunny day
'Cause on you, my tattoo will be bleeding and the name will stain

And oh, if you stay
We'll ride through disguised suburban graves
We'll go from the bungalows where the debts still grow each day
And oh, if you stay
I'll chase the rain-blown fears away
We'll shine like the morning and sin in the sun

Wild! Boys!

The wild boys are calling
On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over
Secrets they could tell
Pre-Chorus
They tried to tame you
Looks like they'll try again

Today seems like a good day to burn a bridge or two
The one with old wood creaking that would burn right away on cue
I try to be not like that, but some people really suck
Some people need to get the axing, chalk it up to bad luck
I know a drugstore cowgirl so afraid of getting bored
She’s always running from something, so many things ignored
I might do that stuff if it didn’t make me feel like shit
I’m on some old reality tip, so many trips in it

Flyin' down the street again
I tried to keep up
You wore me out and left me ate up
Now I wish you all the luck
You’re a butterfly in the wind without a care
A pretty train crash to me and I can’t care
I do, I don’t, whatever

In bad times, when it's dark and cold
You got no place to rest your soul
There's laughter behind your backs
Then it seems the devil rules the deck
Nothin' seems easy these days
Or do I see it in a different way
The world is spinnin', well that's OK
Tell me baby what's the price we pay
Holy holy life, sometimes is lonely
Holy holy life, sometimes is sad
Holy holy life, sometimes is phoney
The sooner or later, they'll find you dead
Why don't you take me down to a rabbit hole
Where a man of peace can hide his soul
Thinkin' about pollution and a birth-control
Better talk to the rabbits, it's somebodies fault
And maybe sometimes I'm pessimistic
And maybe it ain't so bad, it ain't so sick
I know I'm not the man of constant sorrow
And tell me is it the path of evil to follow

Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe what's evil
Is making love and making friends
And meeting God your own way, the right way

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile
We stand alone

The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped they ran
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me, I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god



Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of Heaven/Hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching say your prayers
Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
About to take the ultimate test in life
I question things because I am human
And call no one my father who's no closer that a stranger
I won't listen

I remember when we used to walk together
Used to talk together, go to the park together
In all kinds of weather we would share
This common pleasure with most of human kinds
It was a kind of treasure, one that I was surely glad to find
But I got one right here and I'm okay
I'm okay, and you're okay, and we're okay
I'm alright, everything else is alright sometimes
Just remember those bones they get broken
And love is not a token of affection
It's not even a real thing, it's a word
So don't you try to buy it out with a ring
'Cause it's a verb to love someone
Open up and let them in
Just don't be afraid to set them free again
That I ain't ever seen
I'm gonna keep on keeping on
I'm gonna reap on being strong
I got my head on, though mis connected
It's alright 'cause I do it protected
I got a day job, I drive a cheap ride
Sounds like I'm gonna fine
You only get one life to learn
There's only so many brain cells that you can burn
And life can take a turn and take away that you've earned
And leave you yearning for more, so much more
Life is gonna leave you yearning for more, more, more
Your stomach's gonna be churning
Wanting more, you're wanting, wanting some more
You're wanting some more, more, more
Do you want some?
Well, I got some right here and I'm okay
I'm okay and you're okay, ha ha, we're okay

Summer nights and long warm days
Are stolen as the old moon falls
My mirror shows another face
Another place to hide it all
Another place to hide it all

And I'm lost, behind
The words I'll never find
And I'm left behind
As seasons roll on by

Sleeping with a full moon blanket
Sand and feathers for my head
Dreams have never been the answer
And dreams have never made my bed
Dreams have never made my bed


Now I want to fly above the storm
But you can't grow feathers in the rain
And the naked floor is cold as hell
This naked floor reminds me
Oh the naked floor reminds me


If I should be short on words
And long on things to say
Could you crawl into my world
And take me worlds away
Should I be beside myself
And not even stay

The word that would
Best describe this feeling would be, 'haunted'
I touch the clothes you left behind
That still retain your shape and lines, still haunted
I trace the outline of your eyes
Blue in the mirror, hypnotized and haunted
I find a solitary hair gone
And still I reminisce, I'm haunted
Haunted by your soul
Haunted by your hair
Haunted by your clothes
Haunted by your eyes
By your soul, by your hair
By your clothes, by your eyes
By your voice, by your smile
By your mouth, by your soul
By your hair, by your clothes
By your eyes, by your voice
By your smile, by your mouth
By your soul, haunted (haunted)
So this is for when you feel happy
And this is for when you feel sad
And this is for when you feel...
Nothing
Ohh, when the minutes drag
Ohh, when the minutes drag
And this is for the tears that won't dry
And this is for a bright blue sky
And this is for when you feel...
Lucky
And this is for when you feel...
Lucky
Ohh, when the minutes drag
Ohh, when the minutes drag
So this is for when you're feeling happy again
And this is for when you're feeling sad
And this is for when you feel...
Something
Ohh, when the minutes drag
Ohh, when the minutes drag
Haunted (haunted)
When the minutes drag

Just before our love got lost you said
""I am as constant as a northern star""
And I said, ""Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar""
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me, you said
""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said
""Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed""

Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Until the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war
Dreams of liars
Dreams of dragons fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land


Now I lay me down to sleep
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the lord my soul to keep
(Pray the lord my soul to keep)
And
If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the lord my soul to take
(Pray the lord my soul to take)

Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

Come on people
Hey yeah, oh oh yeah

We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand

I don't wanna hear about it anymore
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore
There's a fire in my heart
A pounding in my brain
It's driving me crazy

Can we close the door
I just made one mistake
I didn't know what to say
When you called me baby

Don't say goodnight
Say you're gonna stay forever
Oh, whoa, all the way

Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket, on truth devoured
A silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The cameras eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes, a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fist-a-gons, the bullets, and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!

You must leave now take what you need
You think will last
But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out baby, the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now baby blue
The highway is for gamblers better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too is fallin in over you- ooo
And it's all over now baby blue
Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the debt you left that will not follow you
Your lover who has just walked through the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is foldin' over you
And it's all over now baby blue
Well strike another match, yeah, go start a-new
Go start a-new
'Cause it's all over now baby blue
Hey, hey, yeah

He's been hanging 'round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell

Gather the bones and lay them in the sun
In patterns that capture the eye
No one could know, display for everyone
The holes in our souls we despise
Timber and stone, monumental
Remnants frozen in time
Carried alone the burden
Knowing it was all we could do to survive

Only embers remain
Refusing to fade
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain
Black turning to gray
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain

Scatter the dust, what we once held
In hand seems was never at all
Gone in a gust, not ours to understand
An agony perpetual
Holding my breath and close my eyes
For a second I can see you again
Motionless, like that day
We lost who we both should have been

Only embers remain
Refusing to fade
There's still light to find our way
Only embers remain
Black turning to gray
There's still light to find our way
Only embers...

(She's so still, she's so still)
Waiting for this endless night to color into dawn

But it's never lifting, it's always shifting
No one can breathe
It holds me under, and this drags down you
(It drags you down, it drags you down)
This breaks what was made one into two
