Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give
The best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown
I broke my heart
Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains

I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity

I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands


You're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine


I will be
I will be free
I will be
I will be free

Que se arruinen los canales de noticias
Con lo mucho que odio la televisión
Que se vuelvan anticuadas las sonrisas
Y se extingan todas las puestas de sol
Que se supriman las doctrinas y deberes
Que se terminen las peliculas de acción
Que se destruyan en el mundo los placeres
Y que se escriba hoy una última canción

Pero que me quedes tú
Y me quede tu abrazo
Y el beso que inventas cada día
Y que me quede aquí después del ocaso
Para siempre tu melancolía
Por que yo, sí, que dependo de tí
Y si me quedas tú
Me queda la vida

Que desaparescan todos los vecinos
Y se coman las sobras de mi inocencia
Que se vayan uno a uno los amigos
Y acribillen mi pedazo de conciencia
Que se consuman las palabras en los lábios
Que contaminen todo el agua del planeta
O que renuncien los filántropos y sábios
Y que se muera hoy hasta el último poeta

This is a story about a girl named Lucky

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""
And they say

""She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?""

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""
And they say

""She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?""

""Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!""
""I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky""
""Oh my God, here she comes!""

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

""She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?""

You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away

I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run, sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

I don't wanna be so shy, oh, oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me

Put your head against my life
What do you hear?
A million words just trying to make
The love song of the year
Close your eyes but don't forget
What you have heard
A man who's trying to say three words
The words that make me scared

And here I am trying to tell you that I care
A million love songs later
And here I am, here I am
Million love songs later
And here I am
Looking to the future now
This is what I see
Million chances pass me by
Million chances to hold you
Take me back, take me back
To where I used to be
And hide away from all my truths
Through the light I see
A million love songs later
And here I am trying to tell you that I care

Cherish, cherish

So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
I can't let go, baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Cherish the thought of always having you here by my side

Estoy seguro que esta vez No habra marcha atras
Despues de todo fui yo a decirte que no
Sabes bien que no es cierto
Estoy muriendo por dentro
Y ahora es que me doy cuenta
Que sin ti no soy nada
He perdido las fuerzas
He perdido las ganas
He intentado encontrarte
En otras personas
No es igual
No es lo mismo
Nos separa un abismo

Vuelve Que sin ti la vida se me va
Oh, vuelve Que me falta el aire si tu no estas
Oh, vuelve Nadie ocupara tu lucar

Sobra tanto espacio Si no estas
No paso un minuto sin pensar
Sin ti la vida lentamente se me va

Tantas noches en vela
Aferrado a mi almohada
Si pudiera tan solo regresar un momento

Sin embargo aqui sigo insistiendote

Until the rain starts coming down, pouring
Chill, I got my umbrella

There's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've gotta face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll be standing here
And you coming back to me
Is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take
Hey, yeah
Whoa
Take a look at me now

Now you want my love, well that's alright
Well it will be there for you, morning, noon and night
But you gotta be good, and do it right
Ain't got no time for part-time lovin' in my life
Well you wanna be loved, huh, hey that's okay

But you gotta be down, a nigga gotta be true
Cause otherwise this B ain't got no time for you, oh

Otra vez el champagne y las uvas y el alquitran de alfombra estan
Los petardos que borran sonidos de ayer
Y acaloran el animo para aceptar que ya, paso uno mas
CORO: Y en el reloj de antaño como de año en año
Cinco minutos antes de la cuenta atras
Hacemos el balance de lo bueno y malo
Cinco minutos de la cuentra atras
Marineros, soldados, solteros, casados, los amantes
Andantes y alguno que otro cura despistao
Entre gritos y pitos lo españolitos, los enormes
Bajitos, hacemos por una vez, algo a la vez

Cinco minutos antes de la cuenta atras
Hacemos el balance de lo bueno y malo

A los que ya no estan echaremos de menos
Y aver si espabilamos los que estamos vivos
Y en el año que viene nos reiremos
1,2,3 y 4 empiesa otra vez que que la quinta es la una y
La sexta es la dos y asi el siete es tres
Y decimos a dios y pedimos adios que en año que viene a ver si en vez de un millon, pueden ser dos

I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
And just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad
Just one night of

Moonlight, with you there beside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby

Ooooh, I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I want to be with you
In spite of what my heart says
I guess I want you too bad
All I want is

Moonlights, with you there inside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Ooooh, I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise, oh boy
You're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me
Let's make a deal, you roll, I lick
And we can go flying into ecstasy
Oh darling you and me
Light my fire
Blow my flame
Take me, take me, take me away

Ooooh, I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise, oh boy
You're making me high

Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside

Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head

You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin' wit' bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over, put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin' there with the Crist' in your cup

Ayo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
Why you count your jewels thinkin' I'ma cheat you?
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin' things that you won't regret
Lil Kim, the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'ma throw shade if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
